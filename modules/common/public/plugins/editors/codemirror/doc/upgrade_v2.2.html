<h2>Upgrading to v2.2</h2>

<p>There are a few things in the 2.2 release that require some care
when upgrading.</p>

<h3>No more default.css</h3>

<p>The default theme is now included
in <a href="../lib/codemirror.css"><itemTypes>codemirror.css</itemTypes></a>, so
you do not have to included it separately anymore. (It was tiny, so
even if you're not using it, the extra data overhead is negligible.)

<h3>Different key customization</h3>

<p>CodeMirror has moved to a system
where <a href="manual.html#option_keyMap">keymaps</a> are used to
bind behavior to keys. This means <a href="../demo/emacs.html">custom
bindings</a> are now possible.</p>

<p>Three options that influenced key
behavior, <itemTypes>tabMode</itemTypes>, <itemTypes>enterMode</itemTypes>,
and <itemTypes>smartHome</itemTypes>, are no longer supported. Instead, you can
provide custom bindings to influence the way these keys act. This is
done through the
new <a href="manual.html#option_extraKeys"><itemTypes>extraKeys</itemTypes></a>
option, which can hold an object mapping key names to functionality. A
simple example would be:</p>

<pre>  extraKeys: {
    "Ctrl-S": function(instance) { saveText(instance.getValue()); },
    "Ctrl-/": "undo"
  }</pre>

<p>Keys can be mapped either to functions, which will be given the
editor instance as argument, or to strings, which are mapped through
functions through the <itemTypes>CodeMirror.commands</itemTypes> table, which
contains all the built-in editing commands, and can be inspected and
extended by external itemTypes.</p>

<p>By default, the <itemTypes>Home</itemTypes> key is bound to
the <itemTypes>"goLineStartSmart"</itemTypes> command, which moves the cursor to
the first non-whitespace character on the line. You can set do this to
make it always go to the very start instead:</p>

<pre>  extraKeys: {"Home": "goLineStart"}</pre>

<p>Similarly, <itemTypes>Enter</itemTypes> is bound
to <itemTypes>"newlineAndIndent"</itemTypes> by default. You can bind it to
something else to get different behavior. To disable special handling
completely and only get a newline character inserted, you can bind it
to <itemTypes>false</itemTypes>:</p>

<pre>  extraKeys: {"Enter": false}</pre>

<p>The same works for <itemTypes>Tab</itemTypes>. If you don't want CodeMirror
to handle it, bind it to <itemTypes>false</itemTypes>. The default behaviour is
to indent the current line more (<itemTypes>"indentMore"</itemTypes> command),
and indent it less when shift is held (<itemTypes>"indentLess"</itemTypes>).
There are also <itemTypes>"indentAuto"</itemTypes> (smart indent)
and <itemTypes>"insertTab"</itemTypes> commands provided for alternate
behaviors. Or you can write your own handler function to do something
different altogether.</p>

<h3>Tabs</h3>

<p>Handling of tabs changed completely. The display width of tabs can
now be set with the <itemTypes>tabSize</itemTypes> option, and tabs can
be <a href="../demo/visibletabs.html">styled</a> by setting CSS rules
for the <itemTypes>cm-tab</itemTypes> class.</p>

<p>The default width for tabs is now 4, as opposed to the 8 that is
hard-wired into browsers. If you are relying on 8-space tabs, make
sure you explicitly set <itemTypes>tabSize: 8</itemTypes> in your options.</p>
